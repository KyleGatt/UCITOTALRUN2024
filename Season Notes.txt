-OTF and the Judd Lake weir are not running in 2024 due to budget cuts
-Federal managment of the EEZ was established. Tac limits are set (June 18th). 
-Age allocation model is still being used to apportion commerical harvests to various UCI stocks but will require re-orientation of groupings 
-Judd lake, Jim Creek, and Fish Creek age comps were aged by a seasonal technician. There are very likely many errors in those comps as I am seeing high represention in historically poorly represented age classes.
	We will not use Judd age comps but rather relie on the forecast 1/14/2025
-I added in Fish Creek Personal use projected harvests into the total run tracking sheets. This was not done in 2023. 1/14/2025
	- The final total runs have been updated with projected fish creek PU harvest.
